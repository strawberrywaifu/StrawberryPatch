	<h1>Welcome to the Strawberry Patch!</h1>
	<p>Hello! <b>This is my first website.</b> I tried to learn HTML a few days ago, the tutorial was long and a bit boring. I closed out the code editor and said that's not for me. Here I am 3 days later, middle of the night, or should I say morning, trying it again with a different tutorial lol. It is currently 5am EST September 5, 2022. On this webpage you will find my portfolio of the little projects I take on from videos on the web, and aswell cute pictures of fairies, bunnies and possibly some art I have created.</p>
